description:
 This check monitors pending Windows updates on Windows systems. It processes
 data collected by the {ms_win_update.ps1} agent plugin.

 The check evaluates the number of pending updates that require installation
 and can be configured with warning and critical thresholds for alerting.

 Default mapping:

 {OK}: No pending updates

 {WARN}: 1 or more pending updates

 {CRIT}: 5 or more pending updates

 Updates can be filtered using regular expression patterns to exclude specific
 updates from the pending count. This is useful for ignoring updates that
 should not trigger alerts, such as Degender definition updates.
 Ignored updates are still reported in the service details but do
 not affect the service state or threshold calculations.

 The service displays separate counts for pending and ignored updates, with
 detailed lists of all update titles in the service details for administrative
 review.

 You must deploy the {ms_win_update.ps1} agent plugin to Windows hosts
 to collect update information.

discovery:
 One service named "Windows update" is created on each Windows host where
 the agent plugin is deployed and update information is available.
